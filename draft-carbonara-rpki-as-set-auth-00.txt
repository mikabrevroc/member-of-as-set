                 RPKI-Based AS-SET Authorization (RASA)
                  draft-carbonara-rpki-as-set-auth-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   object type called RPKI AS-SET Authorization (RASA).  RASA allows
   autonomous systems to cryptographically sign the membership of their
   AS-SETs, enabling secure AS-SET verification during route filter
   generation.

   The RASA object addresses a fundamental limitation of existing IRR-
   based AS-SET mechanisms: the inability to verify AS-SET membership
   cryptographically.  By storing AS-SET membership in RPKI-signed
   objects, operators can generate route filters with cryptographic
   assurance that AS-SET members are authentic.

1.  Introduction

   Internet Routing Registry (IRR) databases have long been used to
   generate BGP route filters.  The Routing Policy Specification
   Language (RPSL) [RFC2622] defines the as-set object, which represents
   a set of autonomous systems.  However, IRR-based AS-SETs suffer from
   a fundamental security limitation: membership is controlled solely by
   the AS-SET owner, without cryptographic verification or member
   authorization.

   This creates two significant problems:

   1.  *Unauthorized Inclusion:* An AS-SET owner can include any
       autonomous system without authorization, potentially allowing
       route leaks or policy violations.

   2.  *Transitive Chain Attacks:* AS-SET expansion is transitive - if
       AS-SET A contains AS-SET B, and B contains AS C, then A
       implicitly contains C.  This creates a chain of trust where
       compromising any link compromises the entire chain.

   RPKI AS-SET Authorization (RASA) addresses these limitations by:

   *  Providing cryptographic signatures for AS-SET membership via RPKI

   *  Enabling verification during AS-SET expansion

   *  Supporting "do-not-inherit" semantics to prevent transitive
      attacks

   *  Maintaining backward compatibility with existing IRR
      infrastructure

2.  Terminology

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

   RASA:  RPKI AS-SET Authorization object

   CAS:  Containing Autonomous System - the AS that owns the AS-SET

Internet-Draft          RPKI AS-SET Authorization          February 2026


   MAS:  Member Autonomous System - an AS listed as a member

   AS-SET Name:  An RPSL name identifying an AS-SET (e.g., AS-HURRICANE,
      AS1299:AS-TWELVE99)

3.  Design Rationale

   The RASA design is informed by several existing mechanisms and their
   limitations:

3.1.  IRR-Based Approaches

   IRR-based AS-SETs rely on the AS-SET owner's mnt-by attribute for
   authentication.  This has several weaknesses:

   *  No cryptographic verification of membership

   *  Members cannot prevent unauthorized inclusion

   *  Transitive inclusion cannot be controlled

   *  Authentication relies on passwords or PGP keys in IRR

   The member-of-as-set proposal [I-D.member-of-as-set] addresses some
   of these issues but requires the IRR database to support a new object
   type and does not provide cryptographic verification.

   Prior work by Snijders and Korsbäck proposed ASGroup [I-D.asgroup],
   an RPKI-based AS grouping mechanism with a complex opt-out mechanism.
   RASA takes a different approach with a simplified model that
   prioritizes IRR compatibility and incremental deployment.  The opt-
   out mechanism in ASGroup proved difficult to reason about
   operationally and added significant complexity to both specification
   and implementation.

3.2.  ASPA Comparison

   Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) [I-D.aspa] provides
   cryptographic verification of provider relationships.  ASPA proves
   that a Customer AS (CAS) has authorized a Provider AS (PAS) as its
   upstream.

   However, ASPA has a different scope than RASA:

   *  ASPA proves provider-customer relationships

   *  RASA proves AS-SET membership

Internet-Draft          RPKI AS-SET Authorization          February 2026


   *  ASPA is used during BGP path validation

   *  RASA is used during route filter generation

   While both use RPKI, they serve complementary purposes and are not
   interchangeable.

3.3.  Design Goals

   RASA is designed with the following goals:

   1.  *Cryptographic Verification:* Use RPKI signing to ensure AS-SET
       membership cannot be spoofed

   2.  *Member Protection:* Prevent unauthorized inclusion of ASNs in
       AS-SETs

   3.  *Chain Control:* Allow AS-SET owners to prevent transitive
       inclusion attacks

   4.  *Backward Compatibility:* Work alongside existing IRR
       infrastructure

   5.  *Incremental Deployment:* Provide value even with partial
       adoption

4.  The RASA Object

   The RPKI AS-SET Authorization (RASA) object is a cryptographically
   signed RPKI object that authorizes the membership of an AS-SET.

4.1.  Object Format

   The RASA object is encoded using CMS [RFC5652] with the SignedData
   content type.  The eContentType is:

             id-rpki-rasa OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-rpki 42 }

   The RASA content has the following ASN.1 structure:

Internet-Draft          RPKI AS-SET Authorization          February 2026


   RasaContent ::= SEQUENCE {
     version          [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     asSetName            UTF8String,
     containingAS         ASID,
     members              SEQUENCE OF ASID,
     flags                RasaFlags OPTIONAL,
     notBefore            GeneralizedTime,
     notAfter             GeneralizedTime
   }

   ASID ::= INTEGER (0..4294967295)

   RasaFlags ::= BIT STRING {
     doNotInherit(0),
     authoritative(1)
   }

4.2.  Field Definitions

   version:  The version of the RASA format.  This document defines
      version 0.  Future versions may add fields or change semantics.

   asSetName:  The name of the AS-SET being authorized.  This is the
      same name used in IRR databases, e.g., "AS-HURRICANE" or
      "AS1299:AS-TWELVE99".  For hierarchical AS-SET names, the
      containingAS must match the ASN in the hierarchical prefix.

   containingAS:  The autonomous system number of the AS that owns the
      AS-SET.  This AS must be the subject of the RPKI certificate used
      to sign the RASA object.

   members:  A list of autonomous system numbers that are members of
      this AS-SET.  Each ASID must be unique and sorted in ascending
      order.  The containingAS MAY be included in members if it is also
      a member of the AS-SET.

   flags:  Optional flags controlling AS-SET behavior. doNotInherit:
      When set, this AS-SET can be referenced by other AS-SETs, but its
      members are not transitively inherited.  This prevents the "chain
      of trust" attack where including this AS-SET in a malicious AS-SET
      would also include all members. authoritative: When set, this RASA
      is the canonical membership list for the AS-SET.  Tools should
      prefer this over IRR data.

   notBefore, notAfter:  The validity period of the RASA object.  These
      times are interpreted according to RPKI policies.

Internet-Draft          RPKI AS-SET Authorization          February 2026


5.  RASA Verification

   RASA objects are verified using standard RPKI validation procedures.

5.1.  Signature Validation

   The RASA object MUST be validated according to [RFC6488]:

   1.  Verify the CMS signature using the signer's certificate

   2.  Verify the certificate chain to a trust anchor

   3.  Verify the certificate's subject matches the containingAS

   4.  Verify the validity period (notBefore, notAfter)

   5.  Check for revocation using CRLs or OCSP

5.2.  AS-SET Expansion with RASA

   When expanding an AS-SET for route filter generation, RPKI-aware
   tools SHOULD perform the following:

   1.  Query the IRR for the AS-SET definition, obtaining the list of
       members (ASNs and nested AS-SETs).

   2.  For each member ASN, verify if a RASA object exists that lists
       this AS-SET as authorized.  If the ASN has published a RASA and
       this AS-SET is not in the authorized list, log a warning or
       exclude the ASN based on policy.

   3.  For each nested AS-SET, query RPKI for a RASA object for that AS-
       SET.  If a RASA exists with doNotInherit flag set, include only
       the AS-SET reference in the expansion, not its members.  If the
       authoritative flag is set, use the RASA member list instead of
       the IRR member list.  Otherwise, use the RASA member list as
       authoritative and recurse.

6.  Use Cases

6.1.  Content Provider Protection

   Google (AS15169) wants to ensure it is only included in specific
   Tier-1 provider AS-SETs:







Ytti                     Expires 27 August 2026                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          RPKI AS-SET Authorization          February 2026


   RASA Object (signed by AS15169):
     asSetName:     "AS-GOOGLE"
     containingAS:  15169
     members:       [15169, 16509, 36040, 36384]
     flags:         doNotInherit(0) = TRUE

   Now when a malicious AS-SET includes AS-GOOGLE, expansion stops at
   the AS-SET reference and does not include Google's actual ASNs,
   preventing route leaks.

6.2.  Tier-1 Provider Protection

   Arelion (AS1299) wants to protect its customer AS-SET:

   RASA Object (signed by AS1299):
     asSetName:     "AS1299:AS-TWELVE99"
     containingAS:  1299
     members:       [64496, 64497, 64498, 64499, ...]
     flags:         doNotInherit(0) = TRUE,
                    authoritative(1) = TRUE

   The authoritative flag tells tools to use this RASA member list
   instead of the IRR data.  The doNotInherit flag prevents transitive
   inclusion attacks.

6.3.  Enterprise Multi-ASN

   An enterprise with multiple ASNs wants consistent authorization:

   RASA Object (signed by enterprise AS):
     asSetName:     "AS-ENTERPRISE"
     containingAS:  64501
     members:       [64501, 64502, 64503]
     flags:         authoritative(1) = TRUE

7.  Security Considerations

   RASA provides cryptographic assurance of AS-SET membership, but
   several security considerations apply:

7.1.  RPKI Key Management

   The security of RASA depends on proper RPKI key management:

   *  AS operators must secure their RPKI private keys.  A compromised
      key allows an attacker to create fraudulent RASA objects.

Internet-Draft          RPKI AS-SET Authorization          February 2026


   *  RASA objects should be published promptly to minimize windows
      where IRR data is authoritative.

   *  Relying parties must validate RASA objects according to RPKI
      policies and check revocation status.

7.2.  Partial Deployment

   During partial deployment, some AS-SETs will not have RASA objects.
   Tools SHOULD:

   *  Default to IRR data when RASA is unavailable (backward
      compatibility)

   *  Provide configuration options to require RASA for specific AS-SETs
      or all AS-SETs

   *  Log warnings when falling back to IRR for high-value AS-SETs

7.3.  Chain Attack Mitigation

   The doNotInherit flag mitigates transitive chain attacks.  However,
   if an AS-SET owner does not set this flag, their members remain
   vulnerable to transitive inclusion.  AS-SET owners should carefully
   consider whether their AS-SET should be transitively inheritable.

7.4.  Chain-of-Trust Limitations

   RASA provides cryptographic verification of individual AS-SETs, but a
   fundamental limitation remains: AS-SET expansion is transitive.  When
   AS-SET A contains AS-SET B, and B contains AS-SET C, then A
   implicitly contains all members of C.

   This creates a chain-of-trust problem: an attacker who compromises
   any AS-SET in the expansion chain can include arbitrary ASNs.  For
   example, if a malicious actor creates AS-EVIL containing AS-GOOGLE,
   and AS-GOOGLE has not set the doNotInherit flag, then AS-EVIL
   inherits all Google ASNs.

   *Critical Requirement:* For full security, every AS-SET in the
   expansion chain must protect itself.  If any AS-SET in the chain
   lacks RASA protection or does not set doNotInherit, the entire chain
   remains vulnerable to transitive attacks.

Internet-Draft          RPKI AS-SET Authorization          February 2026


   This limitation is not unique to RASA - it affects all AS-SET-based
   routing, including IRR-based AS-SETs.  The difference is that RASA
   provides a mechanism (doNotInherit) for AS-SET owners to break the
   chain.  Full protection requires widespread adoption at the internet
   core: Tier-1 providers and major content networks must publish RASA
   objects with appropriate flags.

8.  Deployment Considerations

   RASA is designed for incremental deployment:

8.1.  Phase 1: High-Value AS-SETs

   Content providers (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) and Tier-1 transit
   providers publish RASA objects for their AS-SETs.  Tools begin
   supporting RASA verification.  Even with partial adoption, operators
   gain cryptographic assurance for high-value AS-SETs.

8.2.  Phase 2: Tool Integration

   bgpq4 and other IRR tools add RASA support.  RPKI validators
   (Routinator, rpki-client) add RASA publication and query APIs.
   Network operators can enable strict RASA modes.

8.3.  Phase 3: Widespread Adoption

   Industry standard to publish RASA objects for all AS-SETs.  IRR
   databases may automatically generate RASA objects from authenticated
   updates.  Route filter generation defaults to RASA-verified mode.

8.4.  Alternative: ASPA Synthesis

   An alternative approach to AS-SET authorization uses existing ASPA
   [I-D.aspa] objects to synthesize AS-SET membership.  Rather than
   creating new RASA objects, operators can derive AS-SET contents from
   the provider relationships already published in RPKI.

   *Concept:* If multiple ASNs list AS2914 as their provider in ASPA
   objects, an operator can synthesize an AS-SET "RPKI::AS2914:AS-
   CUSTOMERS" containing those ASNs.  This is analogous to RIPE-731,
   which uses ROAs to validate route objects.

   *Advantages:*

   *  Uses existing ASPA objects (1000+ already published)

   *  No new object types or infrastructure required

Internet-Draft          RPKI AS-SET Authorization          February 2026


   *  Leverages existing RPKI validation infrastructure

   *  Immediate deployment possible with existing data

   *Limitations:*

   *  Only captures provider-customer relationships, not arbitrary
      groupings

   *  Requires all members to publish ASPA objects

   *  No mechanism for opt-out or complex membership rules

   *  Cannot represent non-transit relationships (peers, IXPs, etc.)

   ASPA synthesis is complementary to RASA.  Operators may use ASPA-
   derived AS-SETs for provider-customer relationships while using RASA
   for complex multi-lateral groupings.  Further research is needed to
   define specific algorithms for ASPA-based AS-SET generation.

9.  Operational Guidance

   This section provides practical guidance for network operators
   deploying RASA in production environments.

9.1.  Publishing RASA Objects

   To publish a RASA object, an AS operator must:

   1.  Generate a RPKI certificate for their AS if not already available
       through their Regional Internet Registry (RIR).

   2.  Create the RASA content specifying the AS-SET name, containing
       AS, member list, and appropriate flags.

   3.  Sign the RASA object using their RPKI private key via CMS
       [RFC5652].

   4.  Publish the signed RASA object to their RPKI repository,
       typically via their RIR's publication service or a private
       repository if using delegated RPKI.

   5.  Ensure the RASA object is included in the repository manifest and
       available via rsync or RRDP.

9.2.  Consuming RASA Objects

   Operators generating route filters SHOULD integrate RASA validation
   into their existing IRR tools:

   1.  Query RPKI repositories for RASA objects alongside IRR AS-SET
       queries.

   2.  Validate RASA signatures using standard RPKI validation libraries
       (e.g., rpki-client, Routinator).

   3.  Apply RASA flags during AS-SET expansion.  Honor doNotInherit to
       prevent transitive inclusion.  Prefer authoritative RASA member
       lists over IRR data.  Fall back to IRR data when RASA is
       unavailable.

   4.  Log validation failures and policy decisions for auditing.

9.3.  Monitoring and Alerting

   Operators SHOULD monitor RASA validation status:

   *  Track RASA objects for critical AS-SETs (content providers, Tier-1
      providers) and alert on validation failures.

   *  Monitor RASA object expiration dates and alert before expiry.

   *  Log fallback events when reverting to IRR data due to missing or
      invalid RASA objects.

   *  Track unexpected AS-SET membership changes detected during RASA
      validation.

10.  Relationship to ASGroup

   RASA builds upon the foundational work of Snijders and Korsbäck, who
   proposed the ASGroup mechanism [I-D.asgroup] in 2022.  While ASGroup
   introduced important concepts for RPKI-based AS-SET authorization, it
   expired without achieving deployment.  RASA represents an evolution
   of these ideas with practical deployment considerations.

10.1.  ASGroup Innovations

   ASGroup introduced several important concepts that influenced RASA:

   *  RPKI-signed AS group objects providing cryptographic verification
      of membership.

   *  Separation between the containing AS (group owner) and member
      ASes.

   *  The concept of controlling transitive inclusion through the
      referenceable flag.

   *  Recognition that IRR-based AS-SETs lack cryptographic
      verification.

10.2.  RASA Simplifications

   RASA addresses several factors that contributed to ASGroup's
   complexity:

   *  *Removed opt-out mechanism:* ASGroup's separate Opt-Out Listing
      objects added significant complexity to validation and reasoning.
      RASA eliminates opt-out in favor of explicit membership
      authorization via the member list.

   *  *Simplified flag semantics:* ASGroup's referenceable boolean was
      replaced with doNotInherit, providing more intuitive control over
      transitive inclusion.

   *  *IRR compatibility:* RASA is designed to work alongside existing
      IRR infrastructure during transition, whereas ASGroup appeared to
      be a complete replacement.

   *  *Clear deployment path:* RASA includes phased deployment guidance
      with incremental adoption stages.

10.3.  Acknowledgments

   The authors acknowledge Job Snijders and Fredrik Korsbäck for their
   pioneering work on ASGroup, which established the foundation for
   RPKI-based AS-SET authorization and identified the critical need for
   cryptographic verification in routing policy.

11.  Failure Modes

   This section documents expected failure modes and recommended
   responses during RASA deployment and operation.

11.1.  Signature Validation Failures

   When RASA signature validation fails, operators SHOULD:

   *  Fall back to IRR data for the affected AS-SET if configured for
      backward compatibility.

   *  Log the validation failure with specific error details (expired
      certificate, invalid signature, revocation, etc.).

   *  Alert operations staff if the failure affects critical AS-SETs and
      strict RASA mode is enabled.

   *  Continue processing other AS-SETs; do not fail the entire route
      filter generation.

11.2.  Repository Availability Failures

   When RPKI repositories are unavailable:

   *  Use cached RASA data if available and within validity period.

   *  Fall back to IRR data with appropriate logging if cached data is
      unavailable or expired.

   *  Retry repository queries with exponential backoff.

   *  Alert on persistent repository failures affecting validation.

11.3.  Policy Violation Failures

   When RASA validation detects policy violations (unauthorized AS-SET
   inclusion):

   *  Exclude the violating ASN from the route filter expansion.

   *  Log the violation with details of the unauthorized inclusion.

   *  Alert network operations if the violation involves high-value AS-
      SETs or appears to be an attack.

   *  Provide configuration option to warn-only vs. reject for gradual
      policy adoption.

11.4.  Chain Protection Failures

   When an AS-SET in the expansion chain lacks protection:

   *  Process the chain normally if the unprotected AS-SET has
      doNotInherit set (intentionally unprotected).

   *  Log a warning when encountering unprotected AS-SETs in otherwise
      protected chains.

   *  Provide option to require full chain protection for high-security
      environments.

   *  Document the specific unprotected AS-SETs for follow-up with
      operators.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to:

   1.  Register the RPKI Object Type for RASA:

   Object Type: RASA (RPKI AS-SET Authorization)
   OID: { id-rpki 42 }
   Reference: This document

   2.  Register the file extension and media type:

   File Extension: .rasa
   Media Type: application/rpki-rasa
