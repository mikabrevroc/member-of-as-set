      <t>
        This document defines a new Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
        object type called RPKI AS-SET Authorization (RASA). RASA allows
        autonomous systems to cryptographically sign the membership of their
        AS-SETs, enabling secure AS-SET verification during route filter
        generation.
      </t>
      <t>
        The RASA object addresses a fundamental limitation of existing IRR-based
        AS-SET mechanisms: the inability to verify AS-SET membership
        cryptographically. By storing AS-SET membership in RPKI-signed objects,
        operators can generate route filters with cryptographic assurance that
        AS-SET members are authentic.

      <t>
        Internet Routing Registry (IRR) databases have long been used to
        generate BGP route filters. The Routing Policy Specification Language
        (RPSL) <xref target="RFC2622"/> defines the as-set object, which
        represents a set of autonomous systems. However, IRR-based AS-SETs
        suffer from a fundamental security limitation: membership is controlled
        solely by the AS-SET owner, without cryptographic verification or
        member authorization.
      </t>
      <t>
        This creates two significant problems:
      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <strong>Unauthorized Inclusion:</strong> An AS-SET owner can include
          any autonomous system without authorization, potentially allowing
          route leaks or policy violations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transitive Chain Attacks:</strong> AS-SET expansion is
          transitive - if AS-SET A contains AS-SET B, and B contains AS C,
          then A implicitly contains C. This creates a chain of trust where
          compromising any link compromises the entire chain.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <t>
        RPKI AS-SET Authorization (RASA) addresses these limitations by:

      <ul spacing="normal">

          Providing cryptographic signatures for AS-SET membership via RPKI

    <section anchor="rationale">
      <name>Design Rationale</name>
      <t>
        The RASA design is informed by several existing mechanisms and their
        limitations:
      </t>
      <section anchor="irr-limitations">
        <name>IRR-Based Approaches</name>
        <t>
          IRR-based AS-SETs rely on the AS-SET owner's mnt-by attribute for
          authentication. This has several weaknesses:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>No cryptographic verification of membership</li>
          <li>Members cannot prevent unauthorized inclusion</li>
          <li>Transitive inclusion cannot be controlled</li>
          <li>Authentication relies on passwords or PGP keys in IRR</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          The member-of-as-set proposal <xref target="I-D.member-of-as-set"/>
          addresses some of these issues but requires the IRR database to
          support a new object type and does not provide cryptographic
          verification.</t>
        <t>
          Prior work by Snijders and Korsbäck proposed ASGroup
          <xref target="I-D.asgroup"/>, an RPKI-based AS grouping mechanism
          with a complex opt-out mechanism. RASA takes a different approach
          with a simplified model that prioritizes IRR compatibility and
          incremental deployment. The opt-out mechanism in ASGroup proved
          difficult to reason about operationally and added significant
          complexity to both specification and implementation.
        </t>

      <section anchor="aspa-comparison">
        <name>ASPA Comparison</name>
        <t>
          Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) <xref target="I-D.aspa"/>
          provides cryptographic verification of provider relationships. ASPA
          proves that a Customer AS (CAS) has authorized a Provider AS (PAS)
          as its upstream.
        </t>
        <t>
          However, ASPA has a different scope than RASA:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>ASPA proves provider-customer relationships</li>
          <li>RASA proves AS-SET membership</li>
          <li>ASPA is used during BGP path validation</li>
          <li>RASA is used during route filter generation</li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          While both use RPKI, they serve complementary purposes and are not
          interchangeable.

      <name>RASA Objects</name>
      <t>
        RASA defines two separate RPKI object types that work together to
        provide complete AS-SET authorization:
      </t>
      <ol spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <strong>RASA-SET:</strong> Defines AS-SET membership (published by
          AS-SET owner). Replaces the IRR as-set object.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RASA-AUTH:</strong> Defines which AS-SETs may include an
          ASN or AS-SET (published by ASN or AS-SET owner). Replaces the IRR member-of-as-set
          functionality.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <t>
        These objects are intentionally separate to maintain clear separation
        of concerns and allow independent deployment. The two-object design is

          When expanding an AS-SET for route filter generation, RPKI-aware

        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal">
          <li>
            Query RPKI for a RASA object for the AS-SET. If a valid RASA
            exists and the authoritative flag is set, use ONLY the RASA
            member list. Do NOT query IRR for this AS-SET. The IRR object
            is treated as deprecated/non-authoritative.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a valid RASA exists but authoritative is NOT set, determine
            the IRR database(s) to query: if irrSource is specified, query
            ONLY that database. If irrSource is absent, query all configured
            IRR databases. Merge the RASA member list with the IRR member list.
          </li>
          <li>
            If no valid RASA exists, query IRR using the same database
            selection logic (irrSource if present, otherwise all databases).
          </li>
          <li>
            For each nested AS-SET in the member list, first verify if
            the nested AS-SET has published a RASA-AUTH (with
            authorizedSet). If so, verify the current AS-SET name is in
            the authorizedIn list. If not authorized, skip the nested AS-SET
            and log a warning. If authorized (or no RASA-AUTH exists), recurse
            using the same algorithm. If the parent AS-SET has doNotInherit set,
            include only the AS-SET reference (not its members) in the expansion.
            Note: The propagation field in RASA-AUTH is for BGP import policy
            signaling and does NOT affect AS-SET expansion.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each member ASN, verify if a RASA object exists that lists
            this AS-SET as authorized. If the ASN has published a RASA and
            this AS-SET is not in the authorized list, exclude the ASN.
            The strictMode flag controls logging: if TRUE, log a security

          The doNotInherit flag mitigates transitive chain attacks. However,
          if an AS-SET owner does not set this flag, their members remain
          vulnerable to transitive inclusion. AS-SET owners should carefully
          consider whether their AS-SET should be transitively inheritable.

      <section anchor="chain-of-trust">
        <name>Chain-of-Trust Limitations</name>
        <t>
          RASA provides cryptographic verification of individual AS-SETs, but
          a fundamental limitation remains: AS-SET expansion is transitive.
          When AS-SET A contains AS-SET B, and B contains AS-SET C, then A
          implicitly contains all members of C.
        </t>
        <t>
          This creates a chain-of-trust problem: an attacker who compromises
          any AS-SET in the expansion chain can include arbitrary ASNs. For
          example, if a malicious actor creates AS-EVIL containing AS15169:AS-GOOGLE,
          and AS15169:AS-GOOGLE has not set the doNotInherit flag, then AS-EVIL
          inherits all Google ASNs.
        </t>
        <t>
          <strong>Critical Requirement:</strong> For full security, every
          AS-SET in the expansion chain must protect itself. If any AS-SET
          in the chain lacks RASA protection or does not set doNotInherit,
          the entire chain remains vulnerable to transitive attacks.
        </t>
        <t>
          This limitation is not unique to RASA - it affects all AS-SET-based
          routing, including IRR-based AS-SETs. The difference is that RASA
          provides a mechanism (doNotInherit) for AS-SET owners to break the
          chain. Full protection requires widespread adoption at the internet
          core: Tier-1 providers and major content networks must publish RASA
          objects with appropriate flags.

        An alternative approach uses existing ASPA objects to synthesize

          <sourcecode type="text">
Step 1: NTT publishes RASA-SET
  asSetName:     "AS2914:AS-GLOBAL"
  containingAS:  2914
  members:       [AS64496, AS64497, AS64498, AS64499, AS64500]

  irrSource:     "RADB"
  validity:      2024-01-01 to 2025-01-01

Step 2: Customer AS64496 publishes RASA-AUTH
  authorizedAS:  64496
  authorizedIn:  ["AS2914:AS-GLOBAL", "AS1299:AS-TWELVE99"]
  strictMode:    FALSE
  validity:      2024-01-01 to 2025-01-01

Step 3: Customer AS64497 publishes RASA-AUTH  
  authorizedAS:  64497
  authorizedIn:  ["AS2914:AS-GLOBAL"]
  strictMode:    TRUE
  validity:      2024-01-01 to 2025-01-01

Step 4: Customer AS64498 does NOT publish RASA-AUTH
  (No objection, included by default)

Step 5: Attacker AS-EVIL attempts unauthorized inclusion
  RASA-SET (AS-EVIL):
    asSetName: "AS-EVIL:CUSTOMERS"
    members:   [AS64496, AS64497, AS2914]  -- attempting to include NTT!

Result: AS2914 excluded (AS-EVIL not in AS2914's authorizedIn list)

Result: Google's AS-SET can only be expanded by authorized Tier-1s.
Any attempt by malicious AS-SETs to include AS15169:AS-GOOGLE will
stop at the AS-SET reference (doNotInherit=TRUE) without revealing

            <strong>Removed opt-out mechanism:</strong> ASGroup's separate

            and reasoning. RASA eliminates opt-out in favor of explicit
            membership authorization via the member list.

          <li>
            <strong>Simplified flag semantics:</strong> ASGroup's referenceable

          When an AS-SET owner publishes a RASA object with the

            <strong>Deletion:</strong> Should the IRR AS-SET be deleted?
            Issues include: lack of cryptographic deletion in IRR,
            persistence in mirrors, and potential breakage of legacy
            tools that do not yet support RPKI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retention:</strong> Should the IRR AS-SET be kept
            indefinitely? Issues include: potential confusion when
            IRR and RASA data diverge, and validators needing clear
            precedence rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deprecation markers:</strong> Can IRR objects be
            marked as deprecated? Issues include: lack of standardized
            deprecation attributes in IRR, and varying support across
            IRR database implementations.
